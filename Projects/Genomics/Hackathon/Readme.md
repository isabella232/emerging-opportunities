## Past Hackathons

### First Hackathon (Sprint 23)
#### What did participants learn?
* This hackathon introduced key concepts and terminology used in the industry.
* Some of the common workflows that our customers are using to derive insight from genomic information.
* Set up and configured Cromwell on Azure as well as Nextflow on Azure.
* Ran through a sample workflow using both technologies.
* Reviewed the output and how this can be used to empower downstream analytic processes.

#### Hackathon Agenda

The hack will be broken down into two sections, a kickoff meeting and the workshop/hack.

#### Kick-off

* We’ll cover the basics of genomics (DNA/RNA, Transcription, Translation etc.). If you’re are a beginner, checkout the quickstart and the video links that we sent out.
* We’ll introduce some of the more common workflows customers are asking about. We’ll focus on DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq but it’s possible your customers could be doing something else. The basics and the tools used will be similar.

#### Hack
* You will break into teams and work on setting up Cromwell on Azure and Nextflow on Azure
* You will run a sample DNA-Seq pipeline on Cromwell and a RNA-Seq pipeline on Nextflow.
* Use this time to discuss with your team and share some of your customer experiences.
