# Genomics News

> See [**Hackathon**](./Hackathon) 

During the past few sprints our team put together a one-day hackathon focused on Genomics. Our customers have a lot of work to do to derive insights and information from the growing volume of sequencing data. Our goal is to get more people comfortable with what our customers are working on and the tools that we have for them to accomplish their goals.

### Why should you learn about genomics on Azure?
Genomics will play a central role in improving healthcare delivery for the foreseeable future. Some of the key areas include:

**Drug discovery** As we've seen with COVID-19 vaccines, understanding the viral genome has led to vaccines produced at remarkable pace.

**Precision medicine** By understanding both the disease as well as the patient's genome, pharma companies can produce more targeted therapies.

**Rare diseases** Some of the most devasting diseases can now be better understood using genetics which will lead to cures.
