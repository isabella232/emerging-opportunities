### [**PowerOrgChart**](./org-chart)

We've all seen the slide deck in a quarterly kickoff or other corporate presentation that shows the little pictures of all of the people on the team. This can be a great way to show appreciation for people in our new virtual setting and to help communicate the size and scale of a large organization. When you do this with a team of five people, it's not too hard to just drag pictures from a folder onto a PowerPoint deck, but when your organization is hundreds of people, this too often becomes an administrative assistant's entire weekend! This is the problem I was asked to solve this week.
