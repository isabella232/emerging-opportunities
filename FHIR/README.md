# FHIR News

## What is it and why do we need it??

FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, a next-generation interoperability standard created by the standards development organization Health Level 7 (HL7). FHIR is designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data, to be quickly and efficiently exchanged.
It's a human readable health record that allows accessibility and interoperability between health record systems.
