# NurseHack4Health News

## What is it?

NurseHack4Health is a free virtual, weekend-long hackathon presented by Johnson & Johnson, SONSIEL, Microsoft, and dev up and hosted on the Microsoft Teams platform. 

This event presents a rare opportunity to bring together individuals with a diverse set of ideas and skills—nurses, other healthcare professionals, engineers, IT experts, and innovators—to problem-solve in a supportive, inspiring, and innovative environment.

The NurseHack4Health virtual hackathon will use the MIT open-source license, one of the most open and popular. Registrants and teams must understand that all ideas and artifacts (e.g., code, documentation, etc.) produced during the event will be publicly available on GitHub and open-sourced under the MIT license.

## Reusable IPs 
Here are some of the reusuable technologies we have built in order to help for future hackathons we or anyone else might want to run.

[MSAL Authentication for React Apps](react-msal-auth.md)

[**User Registration**](https://github.com/microsoft/NH4H-UserReg) (ReactJS, MSAL, GraphQL) - This application acts as a middleware between the registration page and MSTeams. Once the user is registers (using Microsoft account) the application adds the user to NH4H's Teams so they can collaborate with hundreds of other participants through out the hackathon.  

[**Team Builder**](https://github.com/microsoft/NH4H-TeamBuilder) (ReactJS, SemanticUI) - This app allows participants to form their own team based on challenges they want to tackle and skills needed. It leverages their github id and automatically adds tie them to a github team/repo.

[**Gamification**](https://github.com/microsoft/NH4H-GamificationUI) (ReactJS, SemanticUI) - This app gamifies the hackathon. Participants are awarded points when they accomplish the given tasks.

### Spring 2021 - NurseHack4Health: Improving Access to Care

NurseHack4Health: Improving Access to Care is the third in a series of virtual global hackathons made possible through a unique collaboration between SONSIEL, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, and devup that assembles nurses, frontline health workers, corporate healthcare leaders, IT staff, startups, and investors to help solve healthcare challenges brought on and amplified by COVID-19. More than 2,000 nurses from the U.S. and around the globe have participated to date, including nurses from Canada, U.K., Africa, and Australia. The series originated during the onset of the pandemic when SONSIEL’s network of nurses gathered online to exchange bedside triage solutions, evolving protocols, and other insights to help save lives, demonstrating the significant role of nurses in healthcare innovation.

Participants create solutions tied to the theme, “Improving Access to Care,” which address the following focus areas that have become amplified healthcare issues as a result of COVID-19:

- Vaccine Education & Delivery: Conceptualize how to improve and expedite education efforts and delivery to alleviate the further spread of COVID-19.
- Health Equity, Racial Disparities & Inclusion: Create solutions that address the systemic disparities and inequities rooted in many areas of healthcare to help improve the health of communities of color.
- New Models and Settings for Care: Develop ways to improve the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of non-traditional models and settings of care to reduce the burden on hospitals and improve patient outcomes.
- Medical Deserts: Problem solves how to improve access to medical, behavioral, mental, dental, and/or pharmaceutical healthcare services in communities where such resources and services are extremely limited or altogether unavailable.

Participants can also build out a topic category of their choice that can help improve access to care in an area not covered by given topics.

### Fall 2020 - NurseHack4Health: Pandemic Management—Improving Education & Communication.

As part of our larger commitment to supporting frontline health workers amid COVID-19, Johnson & Johnson, in partnership with SONSIEL (Society of Nurse Scientists, Innovators, Entrepreneurs & Leaders), Microsoft and dev up, is excited to host a free, virtual hackathon, "NurseHack4Health: Pandemic Management—Improving Education & Communication." Nurses, other healthcare professionals, engineers, IT experts and innovators will come together for this event during the weekend of November 13 to 15.

Participants will address a key issue during the pandemic: access to reliable health information. With information about the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly changing, many people have turned to social media as their main source of information, highlighting a need for improved communication and trustworthy resources. Hackers will be charged with finding ways to leverage technology to improve access to reliable, trusted education and communication amid a pandemic. Central areas of focus will include ensuring the health and safety of students and teachers in the classroom, relaying to the public the importance of vaccines, breaking down racial disparities and social inequities, sharing best practices across healthcare providers and facilities, and much more.

### Spring 2020 - NurseHack4Health: COVID-19

Five focus areas for the hackathon that participants can join and ideate against:

- Technology/Patient Remote Monitoring Acute Care
- Technology/Patient Remote Monitoring Home Setting
- Patient Transfer, Hand off and Huddle
- Data and Reporting
- Resiliency and Self-Care
