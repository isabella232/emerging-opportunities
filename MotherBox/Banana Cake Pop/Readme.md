# Banana Cake Pop

## What is Banana Cake Pop?

Banana Cake Pop is a GraphQL IDE to explore schemas, execute operations which works well with Hot Chocolate and any other [GraphQL](https://github.com/microsoft/emerging-opportunities/tree/main/MotherBox/GraphQL) server. Banana Cake Pop is based on Monaco and handles large schemas with ease.

Two main columns show you the query you’re currently running and the results of your query.

It provides real-time syntax and error highlighting. As you type, it gives you snippets of the schema documentation, so you know what you are adding to your query.

You can also toggle between the Query document, History of your previous queries and schema to explore the schema Banana Cake Pop was able to automatically acquire.

### Query Documents
You can save the queries and organize them into collections if you use them a lot.

### History of your previous queries
It keeps a running history of your queries.

### Schema
You can explore the schema, filter and drill down into aspects of your schema. It’s interactive, you can view it in multiple columns.

For example, the **Iteration** type to the left shows the fields that make up the type. Each **Iteration** has a field **Iteration Name**, which is an array of the *String* type. If you click on a field, you can expand even further to get more type details.
